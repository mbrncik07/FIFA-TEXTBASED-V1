This is FIFA-TEXTBASED-V1 developed by Micah Bozic of the Dwight Global High School. 
This game includes a FIFA draft and a Penalty Shootout game. 
The Penalty Shootout game requires two players, while FIFA draft requires one player.

SETUP:
(In order to use these files and play, you need to have some sort of Python interpreter. If you want to run it without installing an application, go to: 
www.online-python.com
You then need to download all 4 Python files in this repository, and open all 4 of them in the online interpreter.


If you have an application such as Visual Studio, or another IDE that can run Python, download all 4 of the Python files, 
and open all of the Python files within the same project in your IDE.)

Now that you have opened up the files and are able to use them, run Maingame.py! 

Now your game is underway!

(New developments are being added to the game and the next update is due by October 2022)
